# Russian.songs.1800-1840


Corporas of russian literary songs, folksongs and not songs at all (poetry), 19th century first half.
Russian songs (1800-1840ss). Manually collected corpora of folksong imitations.
Kireevsky collection. Basic contrastive corpora of folksongs.
Sobolevsky collection. Secondary contrastive corpora of folksongs
Songbooks (1800-1840ss). Folksong population of largest songbooks, 19th century first half.
Russian poetry (1800-1850). Russian poetry population, drawn from subcorpus of [**Russian National Corpus**](http://ruscorpora.ru/search-poetic.html) 

All corpuses are availiable in two forms: original and lemmatized. 

Semi-manual normalization was made for "Russian song" corpus and Kireevsky collection to provide some control over extremly heterogeneous folklore texts (in terms of morphology and orthography) and biases due to lemmatization failures. 

To lemmatize things a [**mystem v.3.0**](https://tech.yandex.ru/mystem/) - stemmer for Russian language - was used.
